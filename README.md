## CvWithApi

Asp.Net Core 6.0 and Api were used in this CV site project.
It is built in N-layer architecture.

In addition to these, Entity Framework Core, Entity Framework Tools, Entity Framework Design, Entity Framework Sqlserver packages were used.

The layers I use in the API:

1)Presentation Layer
2)Business Layer
3) Data Access Layer
4) Entity Layer
5) Dto Layer

Validation, Areas, Partial Views, Auto Mapping were also used in this project. It is a project built in line with solid principles.

APIs I created:

1) About 
2) Contact
3) Education
4) Experience
5) Project

Classic create, delete, put, update operations are implemented in these APIs.
